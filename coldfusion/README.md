# Heartland Portico Direct Example with ColdFusion

This is an example of communicating with Heartland's Portico Gateway.

The `PorticoExample.cfm` file contains the needed XML for a CreditSale (charge) transaction, but this can be any supported Portico transaction. We have included a few examples of popular credit transactions, with more available on [Heartland's Developer Portal](https://developer.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/Developer/Info/PorticoGateway) via the Portico Developer Guide and the SoapUI Sample project (contains the XML for the majority of Portico transactions).
