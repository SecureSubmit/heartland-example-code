# Heartland Portico Direct Example with Classic ASP

This is an example of communicating with Heartland's Portico Gateway.

The `default.asp` file contains the needed XML for a CreditSale (charge) transaction, but this can be any supported Portico transaction.  Please see Heartland's Developer Portal https://developer.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/Developer/Info/PorticoGateway for the Portico Developer Guide and the SoapUI Sample project (contains the XML for the majority of Portico transactions).
